# Customer-Segmentation-for-Arvato-Capstone
### The project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.




In this project, I identified segments of population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany, Arvato . These segments will then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data used in this project has been provided by Udacity and its partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task. The Approach used in this project is to clean and pre-process data, analyze demographic data for customers then compare it against demographics information for the general population, use unsupervised learning techniques, PCA (Principle Component Analysis) and k- means algorithm to create clusterings of customer and general population and identify the difference. Finally, I used different models to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into customers.


## Project Motivation
To practice unsupervised machine learning skills and complete the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree capstone project.


## Libraries Required
python 3 and requires the following packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, PCA, k-means, StandardScaler, Imputer and sklearn collections
